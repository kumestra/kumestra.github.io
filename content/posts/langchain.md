# embedding 

> An embedding is a vector representation of a piece of data (e.g. some text) that is meant to preserve aspects of its content and/or its meaning. Chunks of data that are similar in some way will tend to have embeddings that are closer together than unrelated data.

# Environment Setup

```shell
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y python3.12-venv
python3 -m venv langchan_python_venv
source langchan_python_venv/bin/activate
pip install openai
```
